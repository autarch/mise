# pipx Backend <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />

You may install python packages directly from:

- PyPI
- Git
- GitHub
- Http

The code for this is inside of the mise repository at [`./src/backend/pipx.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/pipx.rs).

## Dependencies

This relies on having `pipx` installed. You can install it with or without mise.
Here is how to install `pipx` with mise:

```sh
mise use -g python
pip install --user pipx
```

Other installation instructions can be found [here](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/)

## Usage

The following installs the latest version of [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
and sets it as the active version on PATH:

```sh
$ mise use -g pipx:psf/black
$ black --version
black, 24.3.0
```

The version will be set in `~/.config/mise/config.toml` with the following format:

```toml
[tools]
"pipx:psf/black" = "latest"
```

| Git syntax for latest version         | `pipx:git+https://github.com/psf/black`                |
| Git syntax for a branch               | `pipx:git+https://github.com/psf/black.git@main`       |
| Https with zipfile                    | `pipx:https://github.com/psf/black/archive/18.9b0.zip` |

Other syntax may work but is unsupported and untested.

## Configuration

Set these with `mise settings set [VARIABLE] [VALUE]` or by setting the environment variable listed.

### `pipx_uvx`

- Type: `bool`
- Env: `MISE_PIPX_UVX`
- Default: `false`

If true, mise will use `uvx` instead of `pipx` if
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is installed and on PATH.
This makes installing CLIs _much_ faster by using `uv` as the package manager.

You can install it with mise:

```sh
mise use -g uv
```
